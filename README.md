## TieredProfitSplitter

In this contract, we get closer to the paramaters demanded by real life, as the three employees now earn different amounts. Each employee will receive a different percentage of the total. We record the amount given to each employee and the disburse to Human Resources the difference between the recorded amount and the contracted value.
